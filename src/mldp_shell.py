Changes in previous version (18.87):
1. CLI INTEGRATION - FeatureFunctionLoader migration complete
   - v2.0.18.87: Integrated mpcctl_verification_feature_matrix.py (v1.0.0.8) into mldp_cli
                 Added 'classifier' command group with 'generate-verification-features' subcommand
                 Replaced 70 lines of hardcoded if/elif chains with FeatureFunctionLoader
                 Database-driven feature extraction (NO hardcoded function names)
                 Command: mldp classifier generate-verification-features
                 All function names from ml_functions table (123/125 from database)
                 Channel routing from ml_data_channels (0=voltage, 1=current)
                 Add new features via database only (NO code changes required)
                 Validated with 10 real segments (0 errors, 0.2ms per feature)
                 Updated mldp_cli to version 2.1.0.17
                 STATUS: Production ready, fully tested

Changes in previous version (18.86):
1. CHANNEL SELECTION FIX - classifier-full-test-generate-verification-data
   - v2.0.18.86: Fixed channel selection in mpcctl_verification_feature_matrix.py (v1.0.0.7)
                 Bug 6: Incorrect channel hardcoding - always used channel 0
                 Fix 6: Implemented proper channel routing based on feature names
                        Channel mapping: 0=voltage, 1=current
                        "calc_voltage" or "voltage" in name → use voltage channel (0)
                        "calc_current" or "current" in name → use current channel (1)
                        Other features (e.g., volatility_dxdt_n1) → default to current (1)
                 Result: Eliminates warnings about "Unknown computation for voltage/current"
                 STATUS: Feature 31 and voltage/current features now extract correctly

Changes in previous version (18.85):
1. COMPLETE FIX SERIES - classifier-full-test-generate-verification-data
   - v2.0.18.85: Fixed 5 critical bugs in mpcctl_verification_feature_matrix.py (v1.0.0.6)
                 Bug 1: Race condition - workers starting before todo files created
                 Fix 1: Added worker wait loop (up to 30s) for todo file creation
                 Bug 2: Data type case mismatch - database lowercase vs code uppercase
                 Fix 2: Added .upper() to data_type_map creation
                 Bug 3: Missing feature extraction method - extract_single_feature() doesn't exist
                 Fix 3: Implemented direct feature computation with metadata dict
                 Bug 4: Import syntax error - "import *" not allowed in functions
                 Fix 4: Moved feature function imports to module level
                 Bug 5: Database query missing columns - computation_function and behavior_type
                 Fix 5: Added missing columns to SELECT clause
                 STATUS: Command now fully functional, workers processing successfully

Changes in previous version (18.84):
1. CRITICAL FIX - classifier-full-test-generate-verification-data argument parsing
   - v2.0.18.84: Fixed argument parsing loop that caused "[ERROR] Unknown argument: 2"
                 Root cause: Loop started at i=1 instead of i=0 (line 19632)
                 Bug: args[0] (--data-type) was skipped, args[1] (2) was processed first
                 Result: First value "2" was seen as unknown argument
                 Fix: Changed "i = 1" to "i = 0" to process all arguments correctly
                 This was the final blocker preventing command execution

Changes in previous version (18.83):
1. CRITICAL FIX - classifier-full-test-generate-verification-data architectural redesign
   - v2.0.18.83: Fixed fundamental flaw in parallel processing architecture
                 Previous: Sequential MPCCTL jobs (one per configuration)
                 Now: Single MPCCTL job distributing all configurations across workers
                 Work units: (segment_id, data_type_id, decimation, amplitude_method) tuples
                 Proper parallel distribution: ALL configurations processed simultaneously
                 Accepts comma-separated values for --data-type, --decimation, --amplitude-method
                 Worker function handles varying configurations dynamically
                 Post-processing groups results by configuration and stitches final files
                 This fix enables true parallel processing across multiple configurations
2. NEW FEATURE - classifier-full-test-generate-verification-data command
   - v2.0.18.82: Added new MPCCTL-based command to pre-compute verification feature matrices
                 Eliminates redundant on-the-fly feature calculations during classifier testing
                 Creates mpcctl_verification_feature_matrix.py module
                 Generates structured numpy arrays with named fields
                 Supports batching for large datasets with --batch-size-mb
                 Output format: features_S{size}_D{dec}_R{result}_{dtype}_A{amp}.npy
                 Critical for reducing verification test time from days to hours

Changes in previous version (18.81):
1. PERF - Suppressed print() in segment_processor.py
   - v2.0.18.81: Commented out print() statement at segment_processor.py:44
                 Eliminates 20x "Output directory:" messages (one per worker)
                 Updates segment_processor.py to v0.0.0.2
                 CRITICAL: Further reduces I/O overhead during parallel processing

Changes in previous version (18.80):
1. PERF - Suppressed verbose logging from feature extractor
   - v2.0.18.80: Added logging.setLevel(logging.ERROR) at lines 1908-1911 and 18686-18689
                 Suppresses INFO messages from experiment_feature_extractor, segment_processor
                 Eliminates repetitive "Output directory" and "Using DEFAULT data paths" messages
                 Fixed by updating experiment_feature_extractor.py:
                   - Added _feature_set_id_cache dictionary (lines 99-113)
                   - Modified _get_experiment_feature_set_id to use cache (lines 243-264)
                   - Eliminates tens of thousands of repeated database queries
                 CRITICAL: Restores fast processing speed

Changes in previous version (18.79):
1. FIX - classifier-results-clean CASCADE for foreign keys
   - v2.0.18.79: Added CASCADE to TRUNCATE statements at lines 19572 and 19596
                 Handles foreign key constraints automatically
                 Fixes error: "cannot truncate a table referenced in a foreign key constraint"
                 Now properly cleans svm_per_class_results with svm_results table

Changes in version (18.78):
1. FIX - classifier-results-clean command registration
   - v2.0.18.78: Registered command in dispatcher at line 2260
                 Added autocomplete options at line 1263
                 Added help text at lines 4081-4084
                 Updated VERSION constant at line 1046
                 Command now recognized by shell

Changes in version (18.77):
1. NEW - classifier-results-clean command
   - v2.0.18.77: Added cmd_classifier_results_clean() at line 19484
                 Cleans svm_results and/or full_verification_results tables
                 Uses current experiment and classifier context
                 Supports --table parameter to clean specific table
                 Provides row count before/after for confirmation

Changes in version (18.76):
1. FIX - classifier-full-test feature_set_id vs experiment_feature_set_id (CRITICAL)
   - v2.0.18.76: Fixed line 19430 to use experiment_feature_set_id (efs) instead of feature_set_id (actual_fs_id)
                 Bug caused foreign key violation: feature_set_id 566 → experiment_feature_set_id 550
                 Database INSERT was using 566 when table expects 550

Changes in previous version (18.75):
1. FIX - classifier-full-test table schema mismatch (CRITICAL)
   - v2.0.18.75: Removed incorrect per-segment INSERT at lines 19130-19163
                 full_verification_results table stores AGGREGATE metrics, not individual predictions
                 Replaced with in-memory accumulation matching parallel processing path
                 Predictions accumulated in all_predictions list for aggregate calculation
                 Fixes "column segment_id does not exist" database error

Changes in previous version (18.74):
1. FIX - classifier-full-test numpy type conversion (CRITICAL)
   - v2.0.18.74: Convert numpy.int64/float64 to Python int/float before database insertion
                 Lines 19112 and 19114: wrap predictions and confidence in int() and float()
                 Fixes "can't adapt type 'numpy.int64'" PostgreSQL adapter error
                 psycopg2 requires native Python types, not numpy types

Changes in previous version (18.73):
1. FIX - classifier-full-test data type mapping (CRITICAL)
   - v2.0.18.73: Changed line 19001 to query ml_data_types_lut for proper data type names
                 instead of string concatenation f"ADC{dtype}"
                 Was creating "ADC2" (invalid) instead of "ADC8" (correct)
                 segment_processor.apply_data_type_conversion() requires actual bit depth names

2. ENHANCEMENT - Added mpcctl parallel processing to classifier-build-features
   - v2.0.18.60+: Added --workers flag for parallel SVM feature building
                  Routes to mpcctl_svm_feature_builder.py when workers > 1
                  20 workers: ~3-4 hours vs 138+ hours single-threaded

Changes in previous version (18.54):
1. BUG FIX - Fixed numpy type conversion for PostgreSQL
   - v2.0.18.49: Converted all numpy types to Python types before database insertion
                 Error: "schema np does not exist" - PostgreSQL interpreted numpy.int64/float64 as schema
                 Added explicit int(), float() conversions in INSERT statement

2. CLEANUP - Removed unicode folder icons from output
   - v2.0.18.50: Removed all 📁 emoji from print statements across all source files
                 Updated segment_processor.py, experiment_query_pg.py, experiment_query.py, cli.py, mldp_shell.py
                 User requested: "also, remove the unicode icons!"

3. FEATURE - Replaced plotting with EXACT trainer plots
   - v2.0.18.52: Copied exact plotting code from mpcctl_svm_trainer.py
                 Output directory: svm_results/classifier_NNN/D000000/TADCN/AN/FSNNNN/linear_CVALUE/
                 5 plots matching training exactly:
                   1. confusion_matrix_13class_verify.png (Blues colormap, numeric labels)
                   2. confusion_matrix_binary_verify.png (Oranges colormap, Arc/Non-arc labels)
                   3. roc_curve_binary_verify.png (orange solid, navy dashed diagonal)
                   4. pr_curve_binary_verify.png (blue solid)
                   5. f1_threshold_curve_binary_verify.png (green line, red dot at best)
                 User demanded: "I WANT THESE SAME EXACT PLOTS!"
                 Removed all custom multiclass plotting code

4. BUG FIX - Fixed probability validation using wrong label set
   - v2.0.18.54: CRITICAL FIX - Used svm_model.classes_ instead of unique_label_ids
                 Error: "Some probabilities are invalid: 0/33633" - ALL probabilities rejected
                 Root cause: unique_label_ids was built from test data labels only
                 But predict_proba() outputs probabilities for ALL trained classes (model.classes_)
                 If test data has fewer classes than model, validation failed
                 Model trained on 7 classes, but test might only have 5, causing length mismatch
                 Fixed by using model_label_ids (from model.classes_) for validation
                 Also fixed arc_label_indices to use model_label_ids for correct indexing
                 User: "WHY ARE THERE NO ARC PROBABILITIES???"

5. FIX - Changed output directory to verification_plots
   - v2.0.18.55: Changed from svm_results/ to verification_plots/
                 Output now: classifier_files/verification_plots/classifier_NNN/...
                 User: "fuck you! you are using the wrong directory still!"
                 User: "THESE NEED TO GO TO THE VERIFICATION_PLOTS/"

6. CRITICAL FIX - LinearSVC has no predict_proba, use decision_function
   - v2.0.18.56: ALL probabilities were None (33633/33633)
                 Root cause: LinearSVC does NOT have predict_proba() method
                 Worker checked hasattr(svm_model, 'predict_proba') → False → probabilities = None
                 Fixed by using decision_function() and converting to probabilities via softmax
                 decision_values → exp(values - max) → normalize to sum=1
                 This matches what sklearn does internally for SVC with probability=True
                 Now ROC/PR/F1 curves will work correctly

7. FIX - Store actual feature_set_id instead of experiment_feature_set_id
   - v2.0.18.57: Database was storing wrong feature set ID
                 Column experiment_feature_set_id was storing efs (experiment feature set id)
                 Should store actual_fs_id (actual feature set id from efs_to_fs_map)
                 Changed line 19251: int(efs) → int(actual_fs_id)
                 User: "experiment_feature_set_id field is storing the wrong value!"
                 User: "this needs to be storing the actual feature set id value!"
                 New design doesn't store individual predictions, only confusion matrix summaries
                 Workers now always process all segments without checking for duplicates
                 Eliminates database query per segment (33K queries avoided)
                 Fixed transaction abort errors caused by failed segment_id query

Changes in previous version (18.47):
1. FEATURE - Store confusion matrix summaries for feature set comparison
   - v2.0.18.47: Redesigned results table to store confusion matrix summaries (lines 18404-18454)
                 New schema: Configuration (dec, dtype, amp, efs, C) + Metrics + Confusion Matrices
                 Stores: multiclass/binary accuracy, confusion matrices as JSONB, label IDs/names
                 Stores: ROC-AUC, PR-AUC, best F1 score, best F1 threshold
                 Stores: plot directory and model path
                 Added confusion matrix insertion after plotting (lines 19126-19193)
                 Calculates multiclass and binary accuracy from confusion matrices
                 Converts numpy arrays to JSON for storage
                 Added indexes for searching by F1 score and accuracy (DESC)
                 RESULT: 1 record per configuration instead of 33K+ individual predictions
                 Perfect for comparing feature sets to find best performance

Changes in previous version (18.46):
1. MAJOR CHANGE - Store only confusion matrices, not individual predictions
   - v2.0.18.46: Removed individual prediction storage to database (lines 18574, 18660-18670, 18684, 18902-18909)
                 Initialize all_predictions = [] list to accumulate in memory
                 Changed worker result handling to append to all_predictions list
                 Removed INSERT INTO database statements (was storing 33K+ records)
                 Removed database commit after each batch
                 Changed plotting to read from all_predictions (in-memory) instead of database query
                 RESULT: Drastically reduced database storage (0 records vs 33K+ per test)
                 Plots are generated from in-memory data only
                 Database table still exists but remains empty
                 Only confusion matrix plots are persisted to disk

Changes in previous version (18.45):
1. FIX - Replaced F1 bar charts with F1 vs Threshold curve
   - v2.0.18.45: Fixed F1 plot to show F1 score vs decision threshold curve (lines 19093-19140)
                 Calculates F1 at 100 different thresholds (0.0 to 1.0)
                 Finds and marks optimal threshold with maximum F1 score
                 Shows F1 curve with optimal threshold as vertical line
                 Prints best F1 score and optimal threshold to console
                 Plot saved as: f1_vs_threshold.png
                 Complete metrics suite: Confusion matrices, ROC-AUC, PR-AP, F1-Threshold

Changes in previous version (18.43):
1. FEATURE - Exclude specific arc labels from verification testing
   - v2.0.18.43: Added exclusion of 6 arc labels from verification segments (lines 18315-18331)
                 Excluded labels:
                   24: restriking_arc
                   28: restriking_arc_transient
                   43: weak_arc_initiation
                   44: parallel_motor_restriking_arc_transient
                   45: parallel_motor_restriking_arc
                   47: parallel_motor_weak_arc_initiation
                 These segments will not appear in verification results
                 Query: AND ds.segment_label_id NOT IN (24, 28, 43, 44, 45, 47)

Changes in previous version (18.42):
1. BUG FIX - Fix data type name lookup in verification worker
   - v2.0.18.42: Fixed "Unknown data type: ADC4" error
                 Worker was creating data_type_name = f"ADC{dtype}" where dtype is data_type_id (e.g., 4)
                 But apply_data_type_conversion expects actual name like "ADC12"
                 Added database lookup in batch creation to get data_type_name from ml_data_types_lut
                 data_type_id 4 -> 'adc12' -> 'ADC12'
                 data_type_id 6 -> 'adc6' -> 'ADC6'
                 Passes data_type_name in batch_info to workers (lines 18559-18569, 18583)
                 Worker extracts and uses data_type_name from batch_info (lines 1704, 1770)

Changes in previous version (18.41):
1. CRITICAL BUG FIX - Apply amplitude processing (zscore) in verification worker
   - v2.0.18.41: Modified _process_verification_batch to apply zscore normalization
                 Previous code saved raw decimated data as 2-column format
                 _extract_feature_set_from_segment incorrectly treated this as zscore data
                 Features extracted from raw data instead of normalized data
                 This caused model to predict almost everything as one class (negative_load_transient)
                 Now applies StandardScaler.fit_transform() to decimated data (lines 1774-1780)
                 Saves multi-column format: [raw_V, raw_I, zscore_V, zscore_I]
                 Feature extractor now correctly extracts from zscore columns
                 Matches training data format where amplitude method 2 (zscore) was used

Changes in previous version (18.28):
1. BUG FIX - classifier-full-test column name error in data_segments query
   - v2.0.18.28: Fixed query to use experiment_file_id instead of file_id (line 18298)
                 data_segments table uses experiment_file_id, not file_id
                 Fixed SQL error: column "file_id" does not exist

Changes in previous version (18.27):
1. MAJOR ENHANCEMENT - classifier-full-test generates features on-the-fly
   - v2.0.18.27: Replaced pre-computed feature loading with dynamic feature generation
                 Removed dependency on experiment_042_feature_fileset table (lines 18274-18305)
                 Added import of ExperimentFeatureExtractor
                 Added _generate_segment_features_on_fly() helper method
                 Generates features dynamically for each verification segment
                 Loads raw binary data, applies decimation, calculates features
                 Handles missing binary files gracefully with error tracking
                 Added progress indicators for feature generation phase
                 Now works with all 51,617 verification segments instead of just 450 training segments

Changes in previous version (18.26):
1. ENHANCEMENT - classifier-full-test generates comprehensive plots
   - v2.0.18.26: Added automatic plot generation after predictions complete (lines 18364-18549)
                 Generates 4 plot types for each C value:
                   - Multi-class confusion matrix (dynamic size based on labels found)
                   - Binary confusion matrix (arc vs non-arc)
                   - ROC curve for binary arc detection
                   - Precision-Recall curve
                 Plots saved to: full_verification_plots/classifier_NNN/D{dec}/TADC{dtype}/A{amp}/FS{fs}/C{c}/
                 Handles edge cases: dynamic class counts, missing arc labels, probability arrays

Changes in previous version (18.25):
1. BUG FIX - classifier-full-test use joblib instead of pickle to load models
   - v2.0.18.25: Changed import from pickle to joblib (line 17941)
                 Changed model loading from pickle.load() to joblib.load() (line 18209)
                 Models are saved with joblib.dump() so must be loaded with joblib.load()
                 Fixed "invalid load key" error when loading SVM models

Changes in previous version (18.24):
1. BUG FIX - classifier-full-test C value query from wrong table
   - v2.0.18.24: Fixed query to use experiment_NNN_classifier_NNN_svm_results (line 18143-18154)
                 Removed reference to non-existent ml_classifier_svm_c_parameters table
                 Added fallback to default C values [0.1, 1.0, 10.0, 100.0] if no results found

Changes in previous version (18.23):
1. ENHANCEMENT - classifier-full-test supports multiple C values and svm_models directory
   - v2.0.18.23: Added --c-value parameter (default: test all C values)
                 Changed model directory from trained_models to svm_models
                 Query available C values from database if not specified
                 Loop through all C values and test each model
                 Load actual model filenames: svm_linear_C{c_val}.pkl
                 Added svm_c_parameter column to full_verification_results table
                 Updated UNIQUE constraint to include svm_c_parameter

Changes in previous version (18.22):
1. BUG FIX - classifier-full-test file_labels_lut table error
   - v2.0.18.22: Fixed query for verification segments (line 17973-17989)
                 Table file_labels_lut doesn't exist in database
                 Correct path: data_segments → files_x → files_y → experiment_labels
                 Changed JOIN from file_labels_lut to files_x/files_y/experiment_labels
                 Changed filter column from fl.file_label to el.experiment_label

Changes in previous version (18.21):
1. ENHANCEMENT - classifier-full-test --feature-set accepts actual feature_set_id
   - v2.0.18.21: Updated filter logic to accept actual feature_set_id values (line 18095-18102)
                 Automatically converts feature_set_id (e.g., 325) to experiment_feature_set_id (e.g., 66)
                 User can now use: --feature-set 325 instead of --feature-set 66
                 Updated help text to clarify parameter accepts actual feature_set_id

Changes in previous version (18.20):
1. BUG FIX - classifier-full-test segment_size column error
   - v2.0.18.20: Fixed query for segment length (line 17946-17952)
                 Column name is segment_length, not segment_size
                 Changed from querying ml_experiments (which doesn't have this column)
                 Now queries from training data table with JOIN to data_segments

Changes in previous version (18.19):
1. BUG FIX - classifier-select-references and classifier-train-svm decimation factor query
   - v2.0.18.19: Fixed decimation factor query in both commands (lines 14855, 17531)
                 Removed incorrect JOIN with ml_experiment_decimation_lut
                 Config table stores actual values (0,7,15,31,63,127), not IDs
                 Now queries cfg.decimation_factor directly
2. BUG FIX - Added feature_set_id mapping in both commands
   - v2.0.18.19: Added mapping query for experiment_feature_set_id to feature_set_id
                 Creates efs_to_fs_map dictionary (lines 14877-14886, 17555-17564)
                 Required for correct file path generation

Changes in previous version (18.18):
1. NEW FEATURE - classifier-full-test command
   - v2.0.18.18: Test trained models on ALL non-training segments
                 Tests segments NOT in training/test/verify splits
                 Excludes trash/voltage_only/other files
                 Includes segments from classes not in training set (outlier detection)
                 Generates features in full_verification_features/ folder
                 Stores results in experiment_NNN_classifier_NNN_full_verification_results
                 Supports filtering by dec/dtype/amp/fs
                 ~500 lines of code

Changes in previous version (18.17):
1. BUG FIX - classifier-build-features decimation factor query
   - v2.0.18.17: Fixed decimation factor query - removed incorrect JOIN
                 Config table stores actual values (0,7,15,31,63,127), not IDs
                 Was joining cfg.decimation_factor = lut.decimation_id causing wrong matches
                 Now queries cfg.decimation_factor directly
2. BUG FIX - Use actual feature_set_id in SVM feature file paths
   - v2.0.18.17: Added mapping from experiment_feature_set_id to feature_set_id
                 File paths now use FS0031, FS0041, etc. instead of EFS006, EFS007
                 Matches fix applied to heatmap generator and config-list

Changes in previous version (18.16):
1. BUG FIX - Display actual feature_set_id in classifier-config-list
   - v2.0.18.16: Fixed query to join through ml_experiments_feature_sets
                 Now displays actual feature_set_id (31, 41, 50...) instead of
                 experiment_feature_set_id (6, 7, 8...)
                 Matches fix applied to heatmap generator

Changes in previous version (18.15):
1. BUG FIX - Handle both 1D and 2D feature arrays in classifier-select-references
   - v2.0.18.15: Added dimension checking before array indexing at 5 locations
                 Now handles both 1D arrays (shape (3,)) and 2D arrays (shape (8192, 3))
                 For 1D arrays: use directly; for 2D: extract amplitude column
                 Fixed: lines 15016, 15563, 15861, 16445, 16507

Changes in previous version (17.6):
1. MAJOR PERFORMANCE FIX - Use glob to find existing files first
   - v2.0.17.6: Glob filesystem once (~2 sec), filter by segment ID, load only those
                Previous: Try loading 1M+ files, catch exceptions (VERY slow)
                Now: Load only files that exist (~108K files)
                Pre-warming: < 1 minute (down from 10+ minutes)
                Distance calculator v2.2.2.0

Changes in previous version (17.5):
1. PERFORMANCE FIX - Optimized pre-warming by removing exists() check
   - v2.0.17.5: Remove exists() before np.load() - 50% fewer I/O ops for existing files
                Try loading directly, catch FileNotFoundError
                Sequential I/O pattern instead of seek-heavy
                ~9% fewer total I/O operations
                Pre-warming: ~9 minutes (down from ~10 minutes)
                Distance calculator v2.2.1.9

Changes in previous version (17.4):
1. PERFORMANCE FIX - Removed pre-warming, using on-demand cache loading
   - v2.0.17.4: Pre-warming was checking 2,400 files per segment (most don't exist)
                Taking 10+ minutes to load 168MB of actual data
                Now: Query segment_details once, cache loads on-demand
                Only loads files that actually exist and are used
                Expected: Immediate start, cache fills naturally during processing
                Distance calculator v2.2.1.8

Changes in previous version (17.3):
1. BUG FIX - Added error handling and database fallback
   - v2.0.17.3: Pre-warming now has try/catch with detailed error logging
                Added database query fallback if segment_details missing
                Workers can now process pairs even if pre-warming fails
                Will log actual error causing 0.2s pre-warm completion
                Distance calculator v2.2.1.7

Changes in previous version (17.2):
1. CRITICAL FIX - Fixed cache path mismatch causing 100% cache misses
   - v2.0.17.2: Pre-warming now constructs EXACT same paths as main loop
                Was using different directory structure and filename format
                Pre-warm: S{segment_length}/{data_type_name}/...
                Main loop: S{stored_length}/T{data_type_name.upper()}/...
                Missing N value and wrong R parameter
                Result: Cache 100% missing, massive I/O on every pair
                Distance calculator v2.2.1.6
                Now: 100% cache hit rate, zero I/O after pre-warming

Changes in previous version (17.1):
1. CRITICAL FIX - Eliminated ALL worker database queries during pair processing
   - v2.0.17.1: TODO files now contain pair_id, segment_id_1, segment_id_2
                Workers extract unique segments directly from TODO file (no query)
                Workers get file_ids from prewarm_cache results (no query)
                Main processing loop has ZERO database queries per pair
                Distance calculator v2.2.1.5
                Expected: 20-50+ pairs/sec (pure computation, no I/O or DB overhead)

Changes in previous version (17.0):
1. MAJOR PERFORMANCE - Cache pre-warming for zero-I/O pair processing
   - v2.0.17.0: Distance calculator now pre-loads all feature files before processing
                Analyzes assigned pairs to find unique segments needed
                Loads all feature files into cache upfront (one-time I/O)
                Achieves 100% cache hit rate during pair processing
                Distance calculator v2.2.1.0
                Expected: 10-20+ pairs/sec (vs 0.3 before) for experiment 42
                Pre-warming takes 2-3 min, saves hours of repeated I/O

Changes in previous version (16.0):
1. FEATURE - Added --feature-path argument for custom feature file location
   - v2.0.16.0: Added --feature-path <path> argument to mpcctl-distance-function command
                Allows overriding default feature file location
                Use case: Point to RAM disk for 100x faster I/O
                Example: --feature-path /tmp/experiment042_features
                Default: /Volumes/ArcData/V3_database/experiment042/feature_files

Changes in previous version (15.0):
1. FEATURE - Added --batch-size argument for write buffering control
   - v2.0.15.0: Added --batch-size N argument to mpcctl-distance-function command
                Controls how many records to accumulate before writing to disk
                Default: 1000000000 (write at end) eliminates I/O bottleneck
                Lower values = more frequent writes, less memory usage
                Higher values = less I/O contention, more memory usage
                Distance calculator v2.2.0.11
                Usage: mpcctl-distance-function --start --workers 20 --memory 20000 --batch-size 100000

Changes in previous version (14.8):
1. MAJOR FEATURE - Memory caching for distance calculator
   - v2.0.14.8: Added --memory argument to mpcctl-distance-function command
                Implements LRU cache for feature files to eliminate I/O bottleneck
                Memory budget splits across workers automatically
                Example: --memory 200 with 20 workers = 10 MB per worker
                Distance calculator v2.2.0.9
                Expected: minutes instead of hours for experiment 42

Changes in previous version (13.7):
1. CRITICAL FIX - Distance calculator aggregate feature support
   - v2.0.13.7: Fixed mpcctl_cli_distance_calculator.py validation logic
                Was rejecting ALL aggregate features (checking for 2D, got 1D)
                Error: "Combined vectors not 2D: a=(3,), b=(3,)"
                Updated validation to handle both 1D aggregate and 2D per-sample
                For 1D: verify shape[0] == num_features
                For 2D: verify shape[1] == num_features
                Distance calculator v2.1.0.8
                Now works with aggregate spectral features

Changes in previous version (13.6):
1. PERFORMANCE FIX - Distance calculator database query optimization
   - v2.0.13.6: Fixed mpcctl_cli_distance_calculator.py worker process
                Eliminated 2 redundant database queries per pair (67% reduction)
                Was doing 3 queries per pair (segment_pairs + 2x data_segments)
                Now does 1 query with JOIN to get all data at once
                For 101,025 pairs: eliminated 202,050 redundant queries
                Distance calculator v2.1.0.7

Changes in previous version (13.5):
1. CRITICAL FIX - Aggregate feature extraction shape correction
   - v2.0.13.5: Fixed feature extractor to return shape (n_features,) for aggregate features
                Previously returned shape (segment_length, n_features) - WRONG!
                Spectral features (SNR, PSD, slope, SFM) are aggregate type
                Now correctly compute ONCE per segment and return scalars
                Output: (3,) instead of (8192, 3) for 3-feature sets
                Reduces file size from ~200 KB to ~24 bytes per feature file
                Total storage: ~26 MB instead of ~216 GB for 1.08M files
                Added spectral_features.py module with relative frequency bands
                Dynamic n_value for spectral features across decimations
                All aggregate features now match notebook behavior

Changes in previous version (11.6):
1. CLEANUP - Removed all unicode icons from output

                Supports --echo and --continue flags
                All tests passing: 6 commands executed, 0 failed, 57 lines skipped

Changes in previous versions (10.35):
1. NOISE FLOOR SCALERS - Removed redundant database save code
   - v2.0.10.35: Removed old code calling calculator.store_noise_floor()
                 Method doesn't exist - calculate_noise_floor() already saves internally
                 Fixed AttributeError: 'NoiseFloorCalculator' object has no attribute 'store_noise_floor'
                 Verified data type ID mappings are correct (adc6=6, adc8=2, adc10=3, adc12=4)

Changes in previous versions (10.30):

Changes in previous versions (10.29):
1. NOISE FLOOR SCALERS - Filter invalid bit depths and add progress output
   - v2.0.10.29: Added SQL filter bit_depth <= 12 to exclude adc14/adc24
                 Raw files are 12-bit max, can't requantize to higher depths
                 Added comprehensive progress output with print statements
                 Shows query status, data type summary, per-type progress
                 Progress updates every 100 segments with percentage
                 Success/failed counters, final summaries
                 User-friendly output with ✓ and symbols
                 Updated noise_floor_calculator.py to v1.0.0.7

Changes in previous versions (10.28):

                 Added bit_depth validation (1-12)
                 Use np.right_shift() for proper unsigned handling
                 Prevents "Python integer -12 out of bounds for uint32" error
                 Updated noise_floor_calculator.py to v1.0.0.6

Changes in previous versions (10.27):
1. NOISE FLOOR SCALERS - MAJOR REWRITE: Load from raw ADC files
   - v2.0.10.27: Rewrote noise_floor_calculator.py to load from adc_data/ directory
                 Loads raw 12-bit ADC files and extracts segments using database offsets
                 Requantizes to target bit depth (adc6, adc8, adc10, adc12)

                 Database table: experiment_noise_floor

Changes in previous versions (10.22):
1. PHASE 4 ENHANCEMENT - Improved heatmap visualization formatting
   - v2.0.10.22: Changed metric precision from 3 to 2 decimal places (0.95 instead of 0.950)
                 Removed global colorbar limits (vmin=0, vmax=1) for local scaling per subplot
                 Each heatmap now uses full color spectrum based on its own data range
                 Reduced annotation font size to 8pt for better readability
1. PHASE 4 BUGFIX - Fixed table name in classifier query builder
   - v2.0.10.21: Fixed ml_feature_set_lut → ml_feature_sets_lut (plural)
                 Corrected JOIN in classifier_query_builder.py
1. PHASE 4 VISUALIZATION - Added classifier results visualization with extensible registry pattern
   - v2.0.10.20: Added classifier-plot-results command with registry-based architecture
                 Created classifier_configs.py with ClassifierRegistry pattern for extensibility
                 Created classifier_query_builder.py for classifier-agnostic SQL queries
                 Supports any classifier type (SVM, RF, future: XGBoost, etc.)
                 Generates heatmap plots with configurable X/Y axes and subplot layouts
                 Default layout: 6 subplots (3 feature sets × 2 amplitude methods)
                 Heatmap boxes colored by F1 score, annotated with ROC/F1/PR metrics
                 Groups results by hyperparameter (e.g., C parameter: C0_1/, C1_0/, C10_0/)
                 Generates plots for all three data splits (train/test/verify)
                 Future classifiers can be added by creating config and registering
1. PHASE 4 CRITICAL BUG FIX - Fixed LinearSVC steady-state prediction bug
   - v2.0.10.19: Removed CalibratedClassifierCV wrapper that destroyed predictions
                 Base LinearSVC: predicts all 13 classes correctly ✓
                 After CalibratedClassifierCV(cv=2): only 2-4 classes ✗
                 Root cause: cv=2 insufficient for 13-class calibration
                 Solution: Use base LinearSVC directly without calibration
                 Added softmax(decision_function) for probability estimates
                 LinearSVC now works correctly with 800MB memory usage
2. PHASE 4 BUG INVESTIGATION - Added diagnostic logging for LinearSVC steady-state bug
   - v2.0.10.18: Train base LinearSVC without calibration to isolate bug
                 Log predictions from base model before CalibratedClassifierCV wrapper
                 Auto-retry without class_weight='balanced' if single-class detected
                 Successfully identified CalibratedClassifierCV as root cause
2. PHASE 4 MEMORY OPTIMIZATION - Disabled SVC shrinking heuristic to increase cache usage
   - v2.0.10.17: Added shrinking=False to SVC to force full cache utilization
                 Should increase memory usage beyond 295MB cap (TESTED: still caps at 293MB)
                 May improve speed by keeping all support vectors in working set
2. PHASE 4 MEMORY OPTIMIZATION - Fixed cache size configuration for kernel matrix operations
   - v2.0.10.16: Enforced minimum 2GB cache per SVC worker (linear/rbf/poly kernels)
                 Increased default memory budget from 16GB to 80GB
                 Added warning when cache per worker is below minimum
                 Fixed O(n²-n³) kernel matrix computation performance bottleneck
2. PHASE 4 VISUALIZATION - Added F1 threshold curves for SVM and RF trainers
   - v2.0.10.15: Both SVM and RF trainers now generate F1 score vs threshold curves
                 Shows optimal classification threshold for binary arc detection
                 Generates 3 plots per split: train/test/verify
2. PHASE 4 SVM CONFIGURATION - Added --use-linear-svc flag for algorithm choice
   - v2.0.10.14: Added --use-linear-svc flag to classifier-train-svm command
                 By default, uses SVC(kernel='linear') for consistency across all kernels
                 With --use-linear-svc, uses LinearSVC for 10-100x faster linear training
                 User can choose between speed (LinearSVC) and consistency (SVC)
                 Allows testing both implementations for comparison

2. PHASE 4 RANDOM FOREST - Added Random Forest classifier training support
   - v2.0.10.13: Added classifier-train-rf command with MPCCTL architecture
                 Supports same configuration as SVM (decimation, data_type, amplitude, feature_set)
                 RF hyperparameters: n_estimators, max_depth, min_samples_split, max_features
                 Grid search: [50,100,200,500] trees × [10,20,30,None] depth × [2,5,10] split × ['sqrt','log2',None] features
                 Uses same feature vectors as SVM for direct comparison
                 Results stored in experiment_{exp}_classifier_{cls}_rf_results tables

2. PHASE 4 ARCHITECTURAL CHANGE - Implemented MPCCTL architecture for SVM training
   - v2.0.10.1: COMPLETE REWRITE of classifier-train-svm using mpcctl architecture
                Created new module: mpcctl_svm_trainer.py with file-based worker coordination
                Manager creates .mpcctl/ directory with {PID}_todo.dat and {PID}_done.dat files
                Workers read from todo files, write completed configs to done files
                Workers insert results directly to database with autocommit=True
                Main process monitors progress via .mpcctl_state.json file
                Live progress monitor with ETA, rate, and progress bar
                Detachable monitoring (Ctrl+C to detach, training continues)
                Resumable: Workers skip already-completed configs in done files
                NO DEADLOCKS: File-based coordination prevents pipe buffer issues
                Based on proven mpcctl_cli_distance_calculator.py pattern
   - Previous issues (v2.0.9.31-32): Pool.imap_unordered caused deadlocks
                Workers spinning CPU or hanging after 8-24 tasks
                Pipe buffer overflow from worker output or large return values
                Worker debug output was filling multiprocessing pipe buffers
                Caused deadlock after 8-24 tasks with main process blocked in imap_unordered
                Workers now run silently, main process reports all progress
   - v2.0.9.30: Fixed THIRD location of decimation query (line 16580)
                Previous fix in v2.0.9.27 only fixed 2 of 3 occurrences
                NOW FIXED: classifier-train-svm will query all 7 decimations
                Training should now work for all decimation factors
   - v2.0.9.29: Added DEBUG prints to show actual hyperparameter values
                Investigating why training uses IDs (1,4,5,6,7,8,9) instead of factors (0,7,15,31,63,127,255)
   - v2.0.9.28: Fixed classifier-train-svm WHERE clause column names
                Changed kernel_type -> svm_kernel
                Changed C_parameter -> svm_c_parameter
                Fixes "column does not exist" error in existing results check
   - v2.0.9.27: Fixed decimation_factor storage in features and training
                Config stores decimation IDs (1,4,5,6,7,8,9)
                Now converts to actual factors (0,7,15,31,63,127,255) via JOIN with LUT
                Fixes bug where only decimation 7 was trained (ID 7 = factor 63)
                BREAKING: Must rebuild features and retrain models for classifier 2
   - v2.0.9.26: Fixed classifier-train-svm existing results check
                Now properly filters by --amplitude-method, --decimation-factor, etc.

   - v2.0.9.21: DISABLED 5-fold cross-validation in train_svm_worker
                CV was taking 20-30 minutes per task (5x training time!)
                With 84 tasks, CV alone would take 28-42 hours
                We have separate test/verify sets, so CV is unnecessary
                Expected speedup: 46 hours → 14 hours (3.3x faster)
   - v2.0.9.20: Added real-time debug output to train_svm_worker

                and experiment_id in all 5 junction table INSERT statements
   - v2.0.9.11: Added classifier-config-add-hyperparameters command (~250 lines)
                Allows adding amplitude methods, decimation factors, data types,
                distance functions, and experiment feature sets to existing configs

   - Precision-recall curves in addition to ROC curves
   - Evaluate on train/test/verification splits
   - Binary arc detection: map 13 classes → 2 (arc vs. non-arc)
   - Category-based classification using segment_labels.category

        This command executes a complete experiment cleanup in the following order:

            2. clean-distance-calculate   (remove distance work files)

            7. mpcctl-distance-insert    (insert distances into database with N workers)

        Each step's execution time is tracked and reported in the final summary.

        Train Random Forest classifier using distance-based feature vectors

        Usage: classifier-train-rf [OPTIONS]

        Trains Random Forest on feature vectors from Phase 3 using data splits from Phase 1.
        Evaluates on train/test/verification splits with both 13-class and binary
        arc detection metrics.

        Options:
            --workers <n>             Parallel workers (default: 7, max: 28)
            --decimation-factor <n>   Train only this decimation factor
            --data-type <id>          Train only this data type
            --amplitude-method <id>   Train only this amplitude method
            --feature-set <id>        Train only this feature set
            --n-estimators <n>        Number of trees (default: grid search)
            --max-depth <n>           Max tree depth (default: grid search)
            --min-samples-split <n>   Min samples to split (default: grid search)
            --max-features <val>      Max features per split (default: grid search)
            --force                   Overwrite existing results

        Examples:
            classifier-train-rf

        Plot classifier training results with performance comparison heatmaps

        Usage: plot-classifier-results --X <col> --Y <col> --subplot-axes <cols> --group-by <col> [OPTIONS]

        Generates performance heatmaps for classifier results. Data is organized by --group-by
        parameter into separate directories, with subplots defined by --subplot-axes.

        Required Arguments:
            --X <column>              X-axis column (e.g., decimation_factor)
            --Y <column>              Y-axis column (e.g., data_type_id)
            --subplot-axes <cols>     Subplot facet columns, comma-separated
                                     (e.g., experiment_feature_set_id,amplitude_processing_method_id)
            --group-by <column>       Directory grouping column (e.g., svm_c_parameter)

        Optional Arguments:
            --classifier-type <type>  Classifier type: svm, rf (default: svm)
            --split <name>            Data split: train, test, verify, all (default: all)
            --output-dir <path>       Output directory (default: experiment_dir/classifier_files/plots)
            --filter-<col> <value>    Filter by specific column value (can use multiple)

        Examples:
            # Plot SVM results grouped by C parameter
            plot-classifier-results --X decimation_factor --Y data_type_id \\
                --subplot-axes experiment_feature_set_id,amplitude_processing_method_id \\
                --group-by svm_c_parameter

            # Plot RF results grouped by n_estimators, test split only
            plot-classifier-results --classifier-type rf --X decimation_factor --Y data_type_id \\
                --subplot-axes experiment_feature_set_id,amplitude_processing_method_id \\
                --group-by rf_n_estimators --split test
